# 🧮 Logistic Regression from Scratch

This project implements a binary classification model using **logistic regression**, built from the ground up in Python — without using any machine learning libraries like scikit-learn.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Forward and backward propagation
- Gradient descent optimization
- Custom cost function (binary cross-entropy)
- Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics
- Cost vs. Iteration plotting using Plotly
- Model save/load functionality with `pickle`

---

## 📁 Files

- `logistic_regression.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook containing the full implementation and example usage.
- `utils.py` *(optional)* – Any helper functions (if separated).
- `README.md` – This file

---

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Plotly
- (Optional) scikit-learn for comparison/testing

Install with:
```bash
pip install numpy plotly
